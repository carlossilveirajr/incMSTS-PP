/**
 * @brief This package implements the GSP Algorithm.
 * 
 *        This package implements GSP classic algorithm. There are no alteration
 *        to include any new funcionalty. It's intends to be a base to implement
 *        all new funcionalty on this algorithm.
 * 
 *        On this implementation, the work starts on Sweep, this class open the
 *        database and makes the first and single scan. That returns a vector
 *        with all item in the database file, all item has a name which uniquely
 *        identifies an item and a vector of integer with all occorrence of the
 *        item. This scan retorns number of tuple too.
 * 
 *        After that, all non-frequente items are cut off, it is made by minimum
 *        support value which is setted by user. All items which has support
 *        less than minimum required are discarded. A support value is given by:
 * 
 *        Support (s) = |size of occorence of s| / |Total number of tuple| ; s
 *        can be an item, itemset or sequential patterns.
 * 
 *        Pruning of s happens if Support(s) < Support Mininum Value
 * 
 *        After that the itemset are created by the items. An itemset is a non
 *        empty set of items and means that all items in that set happend at the
 *        same time or on the same tuple. In other words, if Item1, Item2, Item3
 *        are in Itemset1 than Item1, Item2 and Item3 happends on the same
 *        tuple. A set doesn't have sort.
 * 
 *        The itemset are created by combination of all item one-by-one. After
 *        that, all itemset are analyzed and all non-frequente ones are cut
 *        following same principles of Items.
 * 
 *        The sequential patterns are found by combining all itemset one-by-one,
 *        the candidates created by the combination are checked to see their
 *        support as happend before. But, if a sequence s = <i1 i2 i3> happend
 *        than it means in a lot of tuples i1 happen and a lot of that tuple are
 *        followed by others which i2 happend and that's are followed by tuple
 *        where i3 happend immediately.
 * 
 *        The support is how many time s happend divided by how many tuple the
 *        database has and this value must be more than minimum to s be
 *        accepted.

/**
 * @brief This class is the start to GSP.
 * 
 *        This class implements GSP classic algorithm proposed by (Srikant, R. &
 *        Agrawal, R.; 1996).
 * 
 *        On the first interation, the algorithm found all item on databases,
 *        after that all item with support value is less than minimum necessary
 *        are cut off. Based on this items is created itemset, set of almost one
 *        item which will compose the patterns. The vector of Itemset are
 *        checked and all non-frequent itemset is cut off.
 * 
 *        This vector is called candidate becouse has all candidates itemset to
 *        make patterns. All patterns are made combining itemset and check the
 *        support. Interation by interarion, new patterns are created and
 *        that're bigger than older.
 * 
 *        The interation overs when it cannot creat a big pattern.
 * 
 *        An support of pattern/item/itemset S is: S = number of occorrence of
 *        item/itemset/pattern per number of truples in data base
 * 
 *        If i is an item/itemset/pattern, i is cut if only if S(i) < MinSup (
 *        value defined by user)
